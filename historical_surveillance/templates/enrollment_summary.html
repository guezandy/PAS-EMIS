                    <b>Gross Enrollment Rate(GER) : </b> Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) or Gross Enrolment Index (GEI) is a statistical measure that is used to
                        to determine the number of students enrolled in school at several
                        different grade levels (like primary and secondary), and use it to show the ratio of the number of students
                        who live in the country to those who qualify for the particular grade level.
                        The GER can be over 100% as it includes students who may be older or younger than the official age group.
                        the GER includes students who are repeating a grade, those who enrolled
                        late and are older than their classmates, or those who have advanced quickly and are younger than their
                        classmates. This allows the total enrolment to exceed the population that corresponds to that level of education.

                <li><b>Net Enrollment Rate (NER): </b><br />The NER gives information on the extent of participation in
                    a given level of education of children belonging to the official age-group corresponding to the
                    given level of education.<br />
                    NER at primary level has been calculated by grade (from K to grade 6),
                    by relating the population in ages 5 to 11 to the enrolment in those grades.
                    <br /> NER at secondary level has been calculated by form (1 to 5),
                    by relating the population in ages 12 to 16 to the enrolment in those forms.

                    <b>Repetition Rate : </b><br /> ïƒ˜ Repetition Rate is the number of students repeating from a
                    particular year divided by the total enrolment in the previous year.

                <li>
                    <b> Dropout Rate : </b><br />The Dropout Rate is calculated by relating the number of
                    students who dropped out during a given year to the enrolment in the beginning of the year.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Survival Ratio : </b><br />Divide the total number of students belonging to a school-cohort
                    who reached each successive grade of the specified level of education by the number of
                    students in the school-cohort i.e. those originally enrolled in the first grade of primary
                    education, and multiply the result by 100. The survival rate is calculated on the basis of
                    the reconstructed cohort method, which uses data on enrolment and repeaters
                    for two consecutive years.
